Conventions for neuron model names
==================================

For model names we want to use the formula:

::

   dynamics + [element type] + [psc | cond] + synaptic dynamics + [numerics]

And therefore we get:

::

   iaf_psc_delta        IaF neuron with delta-current input pulses
   iaf_psc_exp          IaF with exponentially decaying input current
   iaf_psc_alpha        IaF with alpha-shaped input current
   iaf_psc_alpha_presc  same, with prescient numerics
   iaf_psc_alpha_canon  same, with canonical numerics
   iaf_cond_alpha       IaF with conductance-based alpha input

A further label could specify the number and interpretation of the
``rports``, for example ``iaf_psc_alpha_multisynapse``.

For models based on specific publications the general naming rule is

::

   <model category>_<initials>_year

Examples are - ``iaf_chs_2007`` (Carandini M, Horton JC, Sincich LC
(2007) Thalamic filtering of retinal spike trains by postsynaptic
summation. J Vis 7(14):20,1-11) - ``iaf_chxk_2008`` (Casti A, Hayot F,
Xiao Y, and Kaplan E (2008) A simple model of retina-LGN transmission. J
Comput Neurosci 24:235-252) - ``iaf_tum_2000`` (Tsodyks M, Uziel A,
Markram H (2000) Synchrony Generation in Recurrent Networks with
Frequency-Dependent Synapses. J Neurosci 20:RC50, 1-5)

We haven’t applied these rules completely consistently, but for neuron
models that are mainly known from a single paper and that have not been
given a more general name in the publications that introduced them (e.g.
``aeif`` and ``amat`` models), one should stick to this rule.
