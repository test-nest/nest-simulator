Conventions for synapse model names
===================================

1. Each connector needs to have a meaningful name, *CName* in this
   document
2. The filenames for the connector are lower case and according to the
   following set of rules:

   1. Connection header: ``cname_connection.h``
   2. Connection implementation: ``cname_connection.cpp``

3. Class names for connectors are written in CamelCase and have to
   follow these templates:

   1. Connector class: ``CNameConnector``
   2. Connector properties class: ``CNameConnectorProperties``

4. The connector has to be registered under the name ``cname_synapse``
   with the simulation kernel
