Writing neuron and device models
====================================

We are currently in the process of transitioning from the old way of
writing models for NEST (i.e manually by implementing a C++ class) to
our new python-based modeling language NESTML, which allows to write neuron models
using domain concepts from computational neuroscience as first level
objects and generate the source code automatically.
The project is still under development so not all types of models have been implemented.

If you intend to write your own neuron model, please have a look at `the
NESTML GitHub page <https://github.com/nest/nestml>`__. In case of
questions, feel free to subscribe to the `NEST mailing
list <http://www.nest-simulator.org/community/>`__. If you find any
problems with NESTML, we kindly ask you to open an issue on the `NESTML
issue tracker <https://github.com/nest/nestml>`__ on GitHub.
