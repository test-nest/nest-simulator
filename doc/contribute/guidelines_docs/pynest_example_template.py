"""This template demonstrates how to create an example python script.

   It is based on the NumPy style docstring and uses reStructured text mark
   up. Extra annotations that explain each section are marked with brackets like this
   [[ remove this content ]].

   You can copy this file and replace the text to fit
   your example, but keep the names of section headings in the order you see here. The
   bracketed sections should be removed completely from the final version.

   Your script should contain a complete code-block that begins with all
   necessary imports and ends with code that displays the output.

   Text explanations within the code-block need to begin with a line of hashes.

""" Simulate a balanced neuron with the bisection method
----------------------------------------------------------------
[[What does this script do?]]

This script simulates a neuron by an excitatory and an inhibitory
population of neurons firing a Poisson spike train.
Optimization is performed using the `bisection` method from Scipy,
which simulates the network repeatedly.

[[Why? What is the purpose or aim of this example?]]

The aim  of this example script is to find a firing rate for the inhibitory
population that will make the neuron fire at the same rate as the excitatory
population.

[[who would benefit from this example?]]

People interested in x research may find this useful. The example here may be 
useful  to learn how to apply method Y in NEST.

[[What kind of output is expected?]]

The output shows the target neuron's membrane potential as a function of time.

[[(If applicable) where is this example referenced in the literature?]]

This example is also shown in Sander et al. [1]_.

Notes
------
[[Additional information can be included here regarding background theory, relevant mathetmatical equations etc.]]

The value of :math:`\omega` is X.
For the population and time-averaged from the spiking simulation:
