"""This template demonstrates how a docstring should look.

   It is based on the NumPy style docstring and uses reStructured text mark
   up. Extra annotations are marked with brackets like this
   [[ remove content ]].  Copy this docstring and replace the text to fit
   your function, but do not change the headings and keep the order. The
   bracketed sections should be removed completely from the final version.

    """Return an array of connection identifiers

    Any combination of source, target, synapse_model and
    synapse_label parameters is permitted.

    [[ Deprecation warnings should appear directly after a brief description
      It should state  what version the object was deprecated, when it will be
      removed and what recommend way obtains the same functionality]]

    .. deprecated:: 1.6.0

            `ndobj_old` will be removed in NumPy 2.0.0, it is replaced by
            `ndobj_new` because the latter works also with array subclasses.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : list, optional
        Source GIDs, only connections from these
        pre-synaptic neurons are returned
    target : list, optional
        Target GIDs, only connections to these
        post-synaptic neurons are returned
    synapse_model : str, optional
        Only connections with this synapse type are returned
    synapse_label : int, optional
        (non-negative) only connections with this synapse label are returned


    Returns
    -------
    array:
        Connections as 5-tuples with entries
        (source-gid, target-gid, target-thread, synapse-id, port)

    Raises
    -------
    TypeError

    Notes
    -------

    Details on the connectivity. [[ Here details regarding the code or further
    explanations can be included. This section may include mathematical
    equations, written in LaTeX format. You can include references to relevant
    papers using the reStructured format ]]
