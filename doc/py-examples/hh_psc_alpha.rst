Example using hh_psc_alpha
-------------------------------

This example produces a rate-response (FI) curve of the Hodgkin-Huxley
neuron  in response to a range of different current (DC) stimulations.
The result is plotted using matplotlib.

Since a DC input affetcs only the neuron's channel dynamics, this routine
does not yet check correctness of synaptic response.
