One neuron with noise
----------------------

This script simulates a neuron with input from the Poisson generator, and
records the neuron's membrane potential.

KEYWORDS: iaf_psc_alpha, Poisson generator, voltmeter


First, we import all necessary modules needed to simulate, analyze and
plot our example. Additionally, we set the verbosity to only show warnings
and reset the kernel.
Resetting the kernel removes any nodes we may have created previously and
resets the internal clock to zero. This allows us to execute the script
several times in a Python shell without interference from previous NEST
simulations.



.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 41


    import nest
    import nest.voltage_trace

    nest.set_verbosity("M_WARNING")
    nest.ResetKernel()







Second, the nodes (the neuron, poisson generator (two of them), and the
voltmeter) are created using  the `Create()` function.
We store the returned handles in variables for later reference.



.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 52


    neuron = nest.Create("iaf_psc_alpha")
    noise = nest.Create("poisson_generator", 2)
    voltmeter = nest.Create("voltmeter")







Third, the voltmeter and the Poisson generator are configured using
`SetStatus()`, which expects a list of node handles and a list of parameter
dictionaries. Note that we do not need to set parameters for the neuron,
since it has satisfactory defaults.
We set each Poisson generator to 8 000 Hz and 15 000 Hz, respectively.
For the voltmeter, we want to record the global id of the observed nodes and
set the `withgid` flag of the voltmeter to ``True``.
We also set its property `withtime` so it will also record the points
in time at which it samples the membrane voltage.



.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 67


    nest.SetStatus(noise, [{"rate": 80000.0}, {"rate": 15000.0}])
    nest.SetStatus(voltmeter, {"withgid": True, "withtime": True})







Fourth, the neuron is connected to the Poisson generator and to the
voltmeter. We also specify the synaptic weight and delay in this step.



.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 74


    nest.Connect(noise, neuron, syn_spec={'weight': [[1.2, -1.0]], 'delay': 1.0})
    nest.Connect(voltmeter, neuron)







Now we simulate the network using `Simulate()`, which takes the
desired simulation time in milliseconds.



.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 81


    nest.Simulate(1000.0)







Finally, we plot the neuron's membrane potential as a function of
time.



.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 87


    nest.voltage_trace.from_device(voltmeter)
